					<h1>Music in Movies</h1>
					<h3>Music can serve several purposes that are either important on the<br>
					emotional side of the movie or help/enhance the storytelling. It is not<br>
					only helpful but essential for any director to keep the music in mind <br>
					when shooting the movie, as this can really make an average film or, a<br>
					fantastic one. Take Inception for example, it mostly known for the deep<br>
					intricate story about a group of people that incept ideas into people's<br>
					minds for whatever purposes they might have; yet the music is always<br>
					keeping you in the shoes of the characters, with suspencefull moments<br>
					having the audience clench their teeth for the characters to pull through.<br></h3>
					<div>
					<h3>Now compare it to John Carpenter's The Thing from 1982. Some may have<br>
					noticed that their is not a whole lot of music in the movie.the sound-scape<br>
					for it is usually filled with the characters talking, or their actions<br>
					on-screen. But there are subtle moments when the music does come in,<br>
					like the opening with the dog running in, and whenever a "thing" is<br>
					found out, or attacks a character. But the movie has you so focused on<br>
					the mystery of who could it be, that there is no need for that much<br>
					sound, (there is no need, really to me at least) as its absence is<br>
					filled with your own thoughts about the characters and who is a "thing"<br>
					or a human.

				<h1>Music in TV</h1>
					<p>Now Music in TV shows is not too much a different beast from movies, where<br>
					a director will need to be mindfull of his selection and timing for it<br>
					to be effective for the audience. I feel like this section is really the<br>
					same as movies and I don't have much to add here, and feel like it is a<br>
					disservice to the medium. But this is why there is way to discuss things<br>
					down in the board below.</p>

				<h1>Music In Games</h1>
					<p>This is a great topic I am really excited about, as video games are a completely<br>
					different medium with music than TV shows (there is an exception here somewhat)<br>
					or movies can be. as movies just have you watching the events unfold, in games,<br>
					there is noone driving the main character(s) forward other than the player. With<br>
					this in mind, it is hard to really come up with the music as unlike movies and<br>
					TV, there is no point where the character (player) will do a thing at this exact<br>
					moment during gameplay. Because of this interactivity with the characters in<br>
					game, game developers don't precisly know what the player is doing at any givin<br>
					moment, thus the music could feel out of place if done incorrectly. There are<br>
					some exceptions and workarounds with this however; some devs just make games<br>
					called, (what many refer to as) walking simulators. Where the majority of the<br>
					game is just walking around beautifully designed environments to tell a story,<br>
					but have little to no real gameplay such as, Dear Esther, Gone Home, Everybody's<br>
					Gone to the Rapture, or Firewatch. Very stunning looking environments in these<br>
					games, but not much gameplay (all the player does is walk around looking for story),<br>
					which can be a nice bit of fresh air when playing. But the music is actually  a<br>
					little more set up like a movie, or cutscenes that happen in a video game, where<br>
					the music is pretty much set the whole way through the game.</p><br>
					<div>
						<p>Those are some games that with the way the developers set them up, they could more<br>
						or less, make them an interactive movie, or, as close to a movie/Tv show as they could<br>
						for whatever their reasons where. But now we get to the good stuff. the games like<br>
						Dead Space, or Red Dead Redemption 2, Halo: Combat Evolved, the vast majority of games<br>
						fit here, be they a First-person shooter, a 3d platformer like Banjo Kazooie, or a<br>
						Virtual Reality game like Boneworks. These games all have the player that can be<br>
						unpredictable at various times, so how does the game developer know when the music<br>
						should change to make a person feel frightened, or ready to Rip and Tear? I'd like<br>
						to let this video share what I feel can help you understand how I veiw music in games,<br>
						and what they can be using "Adaptive music". Be aware, there is light swearing, and<br>
						he is incredibly hilarious.<br>
